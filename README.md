# Memory Game Project

The memory game is a basic matching game that tests the player's memory. In a deck of card pairs, the player has to match each pair to win the game.

## Instructions for Play
To begin the game, click on a card to reveal its content. Only two cards will be revealed at each point in time. The aim of the game is to match each pair of cards with as few moves in as little time as possible.
